TODO

* The tag "latest" should be added to an image in a way that the date is exactly the same. Currently there is a difference of a few seconds and this is super confusing:

$ http https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/marcomm/travis-go-dockerhub/tags | jq '.results[] | {tag: .name, date: .last_updated}'
{
  "tag": "latest",
  "date": "2019-11-01T10:24:19.118637Z"
}
{
  "tag": "0.0.2",
  "date": "2019-11-01T10:24:17.98732Z"
}


* Moving stable tags.

Also the convention to use moving tags for all releases except a patch release, that I understand.

    registry:2.6.2
    registry:2.6
    registry:2
    registry:latest

    When Docker pushes version 2.6.3, they will overwrite all but the 2.6.2 tag. 

* tests within the container
