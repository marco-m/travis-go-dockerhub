* Moving stable tags.

Also the convention to use moving tags for all releases except a patch release, that I understand.

    registry:2.6.2
    registry:2.6
    registry:2
    registry:latest

    When Docker pushes version 2.6.3, they will overwrite all but the 2.6.2 tag. 

* tests within the container
